The general Sympathy and Concern for the Murder of the Lad by the base and infamous Richardson on the 22d Instant, will be sufficient Reason for your Notifying the Public that he will be buried from his Father's House in Frogg Lane, opposite Liberty-Tree, on Monday next, when all the Friends of Liberty may have an Opportunity of paying their last Respects to the Remains of this little Hero and first Martyr to the noble Cause--Whose manly Spirit (after this Accident happened) appear'd in his discreet Answers to his Doctor, his Thanks to the Clergymen who prayed with him, and Parents, and while he underwent the greatest Distress of bodily Pain; and with which he met the King of Terrors. These Things, together with the several heroic Pieces found in his Pocket, particularly Wolfe's Summit of human Glory, gives Reason to think he had a martial Genius, and would have made a clever Man.

A Mourner.
